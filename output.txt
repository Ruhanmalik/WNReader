Pain!So painful!My head hurts!The grotesque dream full of whispers quickly shattered. Zhou Mingrui, who was sleeping soundly, felt an abnormal throbbing pain in his head, as if someone had hit him with a stick. No, it was more like a sharp object had pierced his Sun acupoint and stirred it!Hiss … In a daze, Zhou Mingrui wanted to turn over, cover his head, and sit up, but he couldn't move his limbs at all. He seemed to have lost control of his body.It seems that I haven't really woken up yet. I'm still in a dream … Maybe there will be a situation where I think I'm awake, but in fact, I'm still asleep … Zhou Mingrui, who was no stranger to such encounters, tried his best to focus his mind to completely get rid of the shackles of darkness and illusion.However, when he was half-asleep, his mind was always fleeting like smoke, difficult to control and difficult to restrain. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't help but let his thoughts wander and distracting thoughts appear.Everything was fine, why did he suddenly have a headache in the middle of the night?And it was so painful!Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage or something?F * ck, am I going to die young like this?Hurry up and wake up!Hurry up and wake up!Eh, it doesn't seem to hurt as much as before?But his brain still felt like it was being slowly cut by a blunt knife …Looks like I can't continue sleeping. How am I going to work tomorrow?How am I going to work?If I have a real headache, of course I'll take a day off!I don't have to be afraid of the manager's nagging!Thinking about it this way, it doesn't seem bad. Hehe, I'll be able to steal half a day of leisure!The waves of pain allowed Zhou Mingrui to accumulate illusory power bit by bit. Finally, he straightened his back and opened his eyes, completely getting rid of the half-asleep state.Zhou Mingrui's vision was blurry at first, and then it was covered with a faint crimson. Zhou Mingrui saw a wooden desk in front of him, and in the middle of it was an open notebook. The paper was rough and yellowed, and there was a sentence written in strange letters at the top of the notebook. The ink was dark and eye-catching.On the left side of the notebook, there was a neat stack of books, about seven or eight of them. On the right side of the wall, there was a grayish-white pipe and a wall lamp connected to the pipe.This lamp was very classical, about half the size of an adult's head. The inner layer was transparent glass, and the outside was a grid of black metal.Diagonally below the extinguished wall lamp, a black ink bottle shrouded in a pale red brilliance, the bumps on its surface forming a vague angel pattern.In front of the ink bottle, on the right side of the notebook, a dark fountain pen with a round belly was sitting quietly. The tip of the pen was glimmering, and the cap of the pen was placed next to a brass revolver.Handgun?A revolver?Zhou Mingrui was stunned. Everything in front of him was so strange. It was completely different from his own room!While he was stunned and at a loss, he found that the desk, notebook, ink bottle, and revolver were all covered with a layer of crimson "veil." It was the light shining through the window.Subconsciously, he raised his head and shifted his gaze upwards.In midair, above the black velvet curtain, a scarlet full moon hung high and shone peacefully.This … Zhou Mingrui was inexplicably terrified. He suddenly stood up, but before he could straighten his legs, he felt a throbbing pain in his head, which made him temporarily lose his strength. His center of gravity involuntarily dropped, and his butt hit the hardwood chair.Pa!The pain didn't affect him. Zhou Mingrui pressed his hand on the table and stood up again. He turned around in a panic and sized up his surroundings.It wasn't a big room. There was a brown door on the left and right, and against the opposite wall was a wooden bunk bed.Between it and the left door was a cupboard. The top was open, and below it were five drawers.At the edge of the cupboard, at the height of a person, there was also a grayish-white pipe embedded in the wall, but it was connected to a strange mechanical device. There were a few exposed gears and bearings.In the right corner of the wall near the desk was something that looked like a coal stove, as well as a soup pot, iron pot, and other kitchen utensils.Past the right door was a dressing mirror with two cracks. The patterns on the wooden base were simple and plain.Sweeping his gaze, Zhou Mingrui vaguely saw himself in the mirror. His present self.Black hair, brown eyes, linen shirt, thin body, ordinary facial features, and a rather deep outline …This … Zhou Mingrui immediately drew a cold breath as many helpless and messy guesses surged in his mind.The revolver, the classical European and American style, and the crimson moon that was completely different from Earth's. All of these pointed to a certain matter!I-I can't have transmigrated, right?Zhou Mingrui's mouth opened bit by bit.He grew up reading online novels and often had fantasies about such things, but when he really encountered it, he found it hard to accept.This is probably what they mean by "Lord Ye likes dragons"?After a few seconds, Zhou Mingrui lampooned himself, trying to find joy in his misery.If not for the pain in his head, which made his thoughts tense and clear, he would definitely have suspected that he was dreaming.Calm, calm, calm … Taking a few deep breaths, Zhou Mingrui tried his best not to panic.At that moment, as his body and mind calmed down, memory fragments suddenly jumped out and slowly appeared in his mind!Klein Moretti, from Tingen City, Awwa County, Kingdom of Rouen in the Northern Continent. He was a recent graduate of Khoy University's history department …His father was a sergeant in the Royal Army. He had sacrificed himself in the colonial conflict in the Southern Continent. The pension he received in exchange for it gave Klein the opportunity to attend a private grammar school, which laid the foundation for him to enter university …His mother was a believer of the Evernight Goddess. She passed away the year Klein passed the entrance exam to Khoy University …He also had an older brother and younger sister. They lived together in a two-bedroom apartment …His family wasn't wealthy, and it could even be said that they weren't doing well. They were currently relying on his brother, who worked as a clerk in an import and export company …As a history graduate, Klein had mastered ancient Feysac, which was said to be the source of all languages in the Northern Continent, as well as Hermes, which often appeared in ancient mausoleums and was related to sacrifices and prayers …Hermes?Zhou Mingrui's heart stirred as he reached out to press on his throbbing Sun acupoint. He cast his gaze at the notebook on the desk and felt that the line of text on the yellowed paper had turned from strange to unfamiliar, from unfamiliar to familiar, and from familiar to decipherable.These were words written in Hermes!The deep, dark ink said:"Everyone will die, including me."Gasp!Zhou Mingrui was inexplicably horrified as he instinctively leaned back in an attempt to distance himself from the notebook and the line of text.He was very weak and nearly fell. He hurriedly reached out to hold onto the edge of the table and felt the air around him turn restless. There were faint murmurs echoing in his ears, giving him the feeling of listening to an elder tell a horror story when he was young.Shaking his head, everything was just an illusion. Zhou Mingrui regained his footing and moved his gaze away from the notebook as he panted heavily.At this moment, his gaze landed on the shimmering brass revolver, and a question suddenly arose in his mind.With Klein's family circumstances, how could he have the money and channels to buy a revolver? Zhou Mingrui couldn't help but frown.While in deep thought, he suddenly realized that there was a red handprint on the edge of the desk. The color was darker than the moonlight and thicker than the veil.It was a bloody handprint!"Bloody handprint?"Zhou Mingrui subconsciously flipped over his right hand that had been pressing down on the edge of the table. He looked down and saw that his palm and fingers were covered in blood.At the same time, the throbbing pain in his head continued. It was slightly weaker, but it was continuous."I can't have broken my head, right?" Zhou Mingrui guessed as he turned around and walked towards the cracked mirror.After a few steps, a figure with a medium build, black hair, brown eyes, and an obvious scholarly aura clearly entered his field of vision.This is the current me, Klein Moretti?Zhou Mingrui was taken aback. As there wasn't enough light in the middle of the night, he couldn't see clearly. Hence, he continued walking forward until he was just one step away from hitting the mirror.Under the crimson moonlight that resembled a veil, he turned his head and checked the condition of his forehead.
